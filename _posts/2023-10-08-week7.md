Week 7 â€“ Week Beginning 10/08/2023:

There were a number of simulation and model updates this week. The simulation environment is now prepopulated with targets at initialization. This should help speed up convergence and allow for experience learning from the onset.

I updated the reward function to be explicitly in line with the Bellman equation. 

Post episode testing, the models, results, and losses (if a NN agent) are now saved to the google drive for later comparison. 

Professor Siasi and I discussed the initial scheme for testing. Some additional research is needed for comparison to more effectively show the results.
