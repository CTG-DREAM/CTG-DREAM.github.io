Week 9 â€“ Week Beginning 10/22/2023:

Upon further testing and review, we decided that the agents need significantly more time steps. The total amount will be increased to 300k. Since the DQN agents require a significant amount of RAM to run and will exhaust the Colab instance well before termination, I will need to run multiple runs back to back and save the model after each run. I will also be performing testing on a single intersection with two sensors and four intesections with three sensors, to reflect a dense and sparse environment.
