Week 3 – Week Beginning 9/10/2023:
The work continues

This week was mostly spent on building out the environment, sensors, targets, and a working simulation. The environment, sensors, and targets have been created with their own classes. This should allow for scalability as we move forward. This simple environment and simulation are working. Its not pretty, but it works. I am not an artist.

We discussed using a simple DQN as the initial RL agent model. This simple model should allow for a proof of concept and so we can confirm that everything is working as intended prior to adding complexity (Occam’s razor.)

I continued reading more papers and articles on federated learning and various RL models. The sheer number of papers out there is a bit daunting.
