Week 8 â€“ Week Beginning 10/15/2023:

This week initial testing began. Three models were tested, DQN, FedDQN, and Random. This initial environment consists of 2 sensors, a single intersection, and 50k time steps. The comparison of saved data showed that the FedDQN performed the best with a faster convergence than the DQN and a higher coverage rate than both the other models. 

The test of 50k steps is limiting the training and learning. The chart implies that learning would have continued if given more experiences. At the current time, the highest tier of Colab server, with high ram enabled, will only allow for 50k steps with 2 agents.  

I might explore restarting the runtime, reloading the models, and continuing to train. But the next step will be to write up the midterm report and start building a final report outline.
