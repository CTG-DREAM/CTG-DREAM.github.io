Week 1 – Week Beginning 8/27/203:
This was a busy week with a lot of administration and structuring. As we started this program, I developed a timeline with deliverables and milestones. I am targeting the week of November 19th for the completion of the project.
My advisor, Dr. Nazli Siasi, and I had spoken a little over the summer about the research and potential topics. We settled on maximizing target coverage of traffic vehicles using federated reinforcement learning. We have a weekly meeting to discuss progress, roadblocks, and next steps.
I’ve made good headway on the literature review and expect to have most of it completed within the next couple of weeks. I have the end of week 4 as the completion date on my timeline. 
I’ve connected with my mentor, Dr. Brian Smith, and we will be meeting this upcoming week, possibly on Friday.
