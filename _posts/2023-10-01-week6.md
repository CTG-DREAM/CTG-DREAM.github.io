Week 6 â€“ Week Beginning 10/01/2023:

I implemented a basic federated model with two agents (to start). Initial testing confirms it is WAI.

I updated the decay function for the exploration of each agent. Closer to an exponential decay of the exploration to provide a longer slower reduction in the amount of exploration. Previously the agent was primed for ~2k steps, and a lot of those experiences were empty from the start.

I Implemented training and testing phases with a termination point, based on total steps. It is currently set for 30k steps of training, 5k steps of predicting, and exit at 35k total. I plan on using this either for episodic evaluation or actual training and comparison.
