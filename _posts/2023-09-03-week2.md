Week 2 – Week Beginning 9/03/2023:

This week was spent on settling the project definition and specification. Essentially the main requirements for the environment, sensors, and targets. The specific agents will be identified later. We discussed how the simulation environment should function. 

Dr. Siasi and I discussed the ongoing nature of the literature review during research. That a lot of reading is performed upfront, but that it is continuous throughout the majority of the research. Towards the end is when we reduce the information for the write up.  I’ll likely need to update the schedule as we move forward.

Next week will be focused on finding a few papers pertaining to what types of sensors are currently being used in traffic coverage and light weight RL models.
